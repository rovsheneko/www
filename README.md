# 3D racing with WebGL
This project was part of the Bachelors graduation project and was build using JavaScript. 
In this project ThreeJS 3d engine for browsers based on WebGL was used as well as PhysicsJS a JavaSCript port for C++ based physics engine to detect collitions between objects.
The app represents a scene where one can drive a car and collide with surronding objects.
The car is controlled using keyboard.
I developed this game and I reused libraries and examples developed by other JavaScript developers that pioneered use of WebGL API on browsers.
The game allowes you to generate any number of cars in the scene, but as you add cars the performance will digrate.
